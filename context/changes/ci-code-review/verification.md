# Automated implementation verification

No live inference, GitHub mutations, paid calls, manual operations, pushes, history rewriting, or repository settings changes were performed.

## Phase 1

- Commit: `a6d8278`.
- Clean package install and contract/package tests: PASS (7 tests).
- Deliberate break: inverted the verdict comparison; the verdict-only gate test failed; restored from staging.
- `npm run verify:deploy`: PASS after fixing Node lint imports.
- Prettier check of package and touched context/config: PASS.
- Sequencing adaptation: brought the planned package Node ESLint override forward from Phase 5 to keep per-phase repository gates green. Existing script globals were preserved; reviewer modules use explicit Node imports.
- Initial repository baseline `npm run verify:deploy`: PASS.

## Phase 2

- Adapter/configuration fixtures: PASS (10 tests, injected fake HTTP only).
- Combined package suite: PASS (17 tests).
- Deliberate break: removed completed-response status guard; incomplete-response fixture went red; restored from staging.
- Prettier check: PASS.
- `npm run verify:deploy`: PASS after documenting the intentionally stalled Promise fixture.

## Pending

Phases 3 and 5 remain unverified. All Manual Progress rows remain pending; no live acceptance evidence exists.
